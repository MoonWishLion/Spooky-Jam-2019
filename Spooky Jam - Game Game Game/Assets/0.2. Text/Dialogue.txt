Oh, look...
There's a cold moon howling, tonight...

Hark! You've come across a most grave state of affairs...
Do you choose to run, or...
Do you choose to fight?

Your demons won't let you go...
How will you get out?

Death loves you dearly.
You're a spirit without roots.
Thoughts have come to haunt.

Right what you have wronged.
Wrong what you have wrote.
